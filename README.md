# Nerf_Turret
3D-Printed, Servo-Controlled Nerf Turret to win battles against my brother. 

This Nerf Turret initially utilized basic Infrared signals to control its motion, and used a push-solenoid to fire darts with an electric flywheel. 
I later passed this project down to another student, and we made use of an IMU to control the motion of the turret. 

This Repo contains two versions of the code: one that uses a physical controller (joystick, buttons) to control the turret, and another that uses a simple IR Remote. 

An Instructables post will be coming soon so that you can access the 3D files as well as instructions on how you can build your own. For now, visit [the google drive link here]([url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/197Ub9znjn6BjNCWjJ8uUZEM8LKh2ExhF?usp=sharing)) to see CAD drawings, the schematic, project diary, and some videos of it in action.
