# Nerf_Turret
3D-Printed, Servo-Controlled Nerf Turret to win battles against my brother. 

This Nerf Turret initially utilized basic Infrared signals to control its motion, and used a push-solenoid to fire darts with an electric flywheel. 
I later passed this project down to another student, and we made use of an IMU to control the motion of the turret. 

This Repo contains two versions of the code: one that uses a physical controller (joystick, buttons) to control the turret, and another that uses a simple IR Remote. 

An Instructables post will be coming soon so that you can access the 3D files as well as instructions on how you can build your own.
