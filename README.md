# Nerf_Turret
3D-Printed, Servo-Controlled Nerf Turret to win battles against my brother. 

This Nerf Turret initially utilized basic Infrared signals to control its motion, and used a push-solenoid to fire darts with an electric flywheel. This Repo contains
two versions of the code: one that uses an Arduino UNO as the control board, and another that uses an Arduino NANO. 

An Instructables post will be coming soon so that you can access the 3D files as well as instructions on how you can build your own.
